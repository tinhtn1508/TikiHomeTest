## Result
For inverse index method:

    As you can see in result_reverse_index.txt file, the all keys (unsigned and
    singed Vietnamese) was search in data set.

    Advantage:

        The complexity of this algorithm is quite low, so the time to get data from
        each key is fast ( time ~ miro seconds).

        It is easy to develop
    Disadvantage:

        I think it hard to maintaenane costs on update, delete and insert.

        The result searching don't have the priority (follow this source, it sorted by the line of product_name)

For BM25 method:

    Using for calculate the score for the document.

    It was combined with "inverse index" method to get result => sorted by the score

    => The result will base on our data sets

    Calculating the score of document, we must loop entire the result of "inverse index" method

    => This the reason why BM25 consume many time for looping (solution: using multithreading)

    The highest time of key in data test is about "397" mili second (using 10 thread)
